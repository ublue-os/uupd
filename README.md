# u(niversal )upd(ate) 

Small update program written in golang intended for use in Universal Blue, updates flatpak apps, distrobox, brew, bootc and rpm-ostree (as a fallback)

Includes systemd timers and services for auto update

# Installation

This will be in the [ublue-os/staging COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ublue-os/staging/), until then you can install from Containerfile:
```dockerfile
  COPY --from=ghcr.io/ublue-os/uupd:{FEDORA_MAJOR_VERSION} /rpms /tmp/rpms 
  # You can use dnf5 to install packages on the image instead 
  RUN rpm-ostree install /tmp/rpms/*.rpm
```

> **Note**
> If you are on an image derived from uBlue main, you will need to remove or disable automatic updates with rpm-ostreed, to do this, you need to remove or change this line in the config file: `AutomaticUpdatePolicy=stage` (set to `none` if you don't want to remove the line)

A: This is meant purely for updating the 'system' components of a Universal Blue image (Distrobox, Flatpak, Bootc, and Brew), anything outside of updating these core components is out of scope
